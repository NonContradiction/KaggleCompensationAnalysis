# KaggleCompensationAnalysis

This project is an analysis of the Kaggle salary survey data found here: https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/kaggle-survey-2017?select=multipleChoiceResponses.csv

Originally done for ST 765 at Loyola University Maryland in Fall 2019, pursuant to my Master's in Data Science. 

The code posted here is updated, trimmed, and commented-upon somewhat. The powerpoint is an untouched artifact from the class presenting the findings.
